+ these rules help the score keeping elves, try to stick to them!
! - input unaltered from how AoC gives it
! - changing langs is just not cricket
! - scripts must be self-contained & their own entry point
! - use any file structure you want
! - whitespace counts but comments & surrounding whitespace don't
! - comments must start on their own lines, with // or # (else they'll get scored!)
!   if you need indentation, use exactly 4 spaces
-   note: if there are characters before these on the line,
-   they will be scored (unless its a comment line)
! - jester entries count for bragging points
!   if a jester entry scores less, then it replaces the serious answer's score
! - (Optional) if parts of a challenge are really similar, only latest will be kept
! - gameover for solving at midnight! (unless club ref calls extra time)
! - you can revise old games, but only if they were solved that day & only within reason

@@ Latecomer rules: @@
+ if you're late to the party, catch up quick as you can, ignore the last rule above till then.

@@ Spectator rules: @@
+ if you want to join but don't fancy the competing then set your
+ .scorecard as "# Spectating with a cool drink" (without quotes)
+ then just leave the rest blank unless you change your mind!

@@ Today's playing conditions: @@
! - heavy snow
